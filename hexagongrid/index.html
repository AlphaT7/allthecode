    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      This hex grid is loosely based on
      <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/" target="_blank">RedBlobGames</a>. The grid is first formed by creating an array of center point coordinates for each hex and then drawn.
      The mouse over effect is calculated by first detecting the hex the mouse is hovering over, finding the nearest hex
      point to find the slope of the line, and then checking each coordinate in the grid against that equation. If it matches,
      it is colored based on which slope it uses.
